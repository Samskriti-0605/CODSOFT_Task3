# CODSOFT_Task3
Develop a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using preprocessing, normalization, and handling class imbalance. Split data into training/testing sets. Train classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) to identify fraud. Evaluate with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and consider oversampling/undersampling.
